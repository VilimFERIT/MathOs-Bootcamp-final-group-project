# MathOs-Bootcamp-final-group-project


The final project of the MathOs Web development bootcamp is a product of a team of 4 people during a 2 month bootcamp, of which 2 weeks went specifically on this app, which is a hotel reservation managment tool.
My part of the project were the Guest, Adress, PostalOffice and Country tables and all the work that encompassed them, including SQL bases, repository and service layers, controllers etc.
